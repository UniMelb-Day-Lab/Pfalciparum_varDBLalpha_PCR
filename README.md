# _P.falciparum_ _var_ DBLalpha PCR

For _var_ genotyping or _var_coding, the sequence region within the _var_ genes encoding the Duffy-binding-like alpha (DBLα) domain of _Plasmodium falciparum_ erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) were amplified in a single-step PCR from genomic DNA (gDNA) using universal degenerate primer sequences to homology block 2 (forward primer: DBLαAF, 5’-GCACGMAGTTTYGC-3’) and homology block 3 (reverse primer: DBLαBR, 5’-GCCCATTCSTCGAACCA- 3’)([Taylor et al. (2000)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166685199001590?via%3Dihub) and [Bull et al. (2005)](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.0010026)) for multiplexed sequencing. **DO WE WANT TO INCLUDE TEXT ON THE SIMPLE MAPPING TO BLOCK D AND H>>>>>>>>>**

## Version 1 Primers
We coupled the template-specific degenerate primers (i.e., DBLαAF and DBLαBR) with a GS FLX Titanium primer sequence (i.e., adaptor). Each of the forward and reverse DBLα primers were barcoded with a unique 10 bp multiplex identifier (MID) tag published by [Roche, 2009]() (For the full primer sequences, see Appendix 1).

## PCR Protocol
This single-step PCR protocol was optimized to maximize amplification success, particularly when working with dried blood spot (DBS) samples collected from participants with low-density infections (e.g., submicroscopic _P. falciparum_ infections).  

The single-step PCR was carried out in a total volume of 40 μL, comprising 2 µL of gDNA template, with final concentrations of 0.5X buffer, 2 mM of MgCl₂, 0.07 mM of dNTP mix (Promega), 0.375 μM of each primer (DBLαAF, DBLαBR; see XXXXXX), 3 units of GoTaq G2 Flexi DNA polymerase (Promega), and nuclease-free water.
